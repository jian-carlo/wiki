# Simple things are better for me

Do not overcomplicate things, do not tolerate bloat, excess.
Be as minimal as possible. May apply to my neovim config, to
my projects, to my way of thinking, and taking notes. Keeps
my mind relaxed; not thinking of anything but what is important.
It gets me doing more stuff faster.

# Not applicable to other things

Obviously, I won't be minimal to my dedication to my work and
the people I care about.
