# Take care of yourself.

You want high grades right? You want to create something
that is meaningful right? You want to prove that you are 
something right? You can't do all of those when you are
dead. It would be hard if you were physically or mentally
handicapped. It would be a waste of your time and money
going to the hospital.

Get some sleep.

Play some games.

Exercise.

Eat healthy.

Get some sunlight.

Talk.
