# My Telescope plugin can't wrap long lines

When `\<leader\>st` is called through my neovim config,
it searches up all markdown tasks in my journal. It's
very convenient until the point where your tasks are long
and you have to insert a newline for easier human parsing.
Calling the function again will only show the first line of
the task.

# It teaches me to be concise

An excuse can be made to be lazy in tinkering more with Telescope
and markdown formatting in general. Just be concise with my tasks.
To think of it, it might be very helpful that my tasks are as minute
as possible.
