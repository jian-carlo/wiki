#programming

# Usage

I use python as a numerical solver;
problems in [[thermodynamics]] most often lead to equations
that are very tedious and/or hard to solve by hand.
I also use python as a graphing calculator as some problems
require graphical answers.

# Modules

[[scipy]]
[[numpy]]
[[sympy]]
[[matplotlib]]
