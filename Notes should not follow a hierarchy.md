# Notes should not follow a hierarchy

Notes should not follow a semantic and logical hierarchy.
It should be as unruly as possible to nurture "wild" ideas and break
out of the conventional way of thinking. This is based on the
Folgezettel method that is referred in this
[article](https://writing.bobdoto.computer/how-to-use-folgezettel-in-your-zettelkasten-everything-you-need-to-know-to-get-started/).
The usage of numbered lists does not appeal to me but I should try.
It gives some mental overhead when writing notes. Or maybe I'm thinking
it wrong.
