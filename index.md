### Scope of Biomaterials Science

* Encompasses medicine, biology, chemistry, and materials science.

### Biomaterials have been used in

* joint replacements
* bone plates
* bone cement
* artificial ligaments and tendons
* dental implants
* tooth fixation
* blood vessel prostheses
* heart valves
* artificial tissue
* contact lenses
* breast implants

### Candidates for biomaterials

* metals
* ceramics
* polymers
* composites
* living cells
* tissue

* **Biocompatibility** is the most important feature of a biomaterial
  THIS is what makes a biomaterial a biomaterial
* **Lightness** translates to comfortability (titanium)
* **Flexibility** for certain use cases (polyurethane)
  * Although some parts of polyurethane can attract platelets, engineers have
    made it so that

### Materials that are bad as a biomaterial

* Can hurt you
* Can dissolve
* Your body can surround it with a protective layer
* it can bond with your living tissue

### Tekashi 6ix9ine

* He has rainbow biomaterial on his teeth (*grillz*)
* Gold or Silver, Diamonds even

### Titanium

* Coating titanium with collagen proteins and a blood thinner like heparin to
  speed up healing
* due to coating titanium with the same molecules as your blood

### Hydrogels

* Hydrophilic structures
* Cross-linked structures
* e.g. Phema used in contact lenses
