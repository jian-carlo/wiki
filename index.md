### Definition of Biomaterials

Two possible descriptions of biomaterials [1]
* A material that is derived from biological organisms such as plants, animal
  fungi.
* Any material that is artificially engineered for biocompatibility for treating
  an injury, replacing body parts. Usually synthetic.

### Polymeric Biomaterials

* The most abundant biomaterials are produced by living organisms.
* DNA and RNA are two of the most important polymeric biomaterials responsible
  for protein synthesis. Proteins are also polymeric biomaterials. [1]
* Cellulose is the MOST abundant organic polymer, a polysaccharide. Another
  polysaccharide is starch. [1]
* The second most abundant polymer on earth is the polyphenol, found in many
  fruits, vegetables, chocolate and grains. [1]

### Wood

* Wood is one of the most important biomaterial. Humans discovered fire by striking
  stone and wood. To let the fire burn for even longer, wood was the readily
  available fuel. [0]
* Wood is an accessible sturdy material, and so humans made structures with it. [0]
* Wood is made of three types of molecules, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignands [2]
    * Cellulose is organized  
    * Hemicellulose is not much organized
    * Lignand as different types of aromatic groups in it, responsible for the
      hardness of the wood
* Most of the wood inside the bark is dead xylem [2]
* Wood creates a "blood clot" instead of blood, it is 'sap' 

#### What can burn?

* Burning wood produces three things or at least three states of matter. A 
  flammable gas, a thick orange liquid, and black charcoal. [2]
* The liquid is called a pyroligneous distillate [2].
    * It is actually composed of two layers, the oily layer comes from the aromatic
      lignands. 
    * The aqueous layer is made up of methanol ("wood alcohol"), acetic acid
      ("wood vinegar"), and acetone.
* The gas is composed of three main gases, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and methane.
* The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignands as they pyrolyze, they form a wide
  variety of shorter molecules [2]
* Charcoal, the solid left behind by wood pyrolysis is almost pure carbon, 90
  to 99% carbon

### Biomaterials have been used in

* joint replacements
* bone plates
* bone cement
* artificial ligaments and tendons
* dental implants
* tooth fixation
* blood vessel prostheses
* heart valves
* artificial tissue
* contact lenses
* breast implants

### Candidates for biomaterials

* metals
* ceramics
* polymers
* composites
* living cells
* tissue

* **Biocompatibility** is the most important feature of a biomaterial
  THIS is what makes a biomaterial a biomaterial
* **Lightness** translates to comfortability (titanium)
* **Flexibility** for certain use cases (polyurethane)
  * Although some parts of polyurethane can attract platelets, engineers have
    made it so that

### Materials that are bad as a biomaterial

* Can hurt you
* Can dissolve
* Your body can surround it with a protective layer
* it can bond with your living tissue

### Tekashi 6ix9ine

* He has rainbow biomaterial on his teeth (*grillz*)
* Gold or Silver, Diamonds even

### Titanium

* Coating titanium with collagen proteins and a blood thinner like heparin to
  speed up healing
* due to coating titanium with the same molecules as your blood

### Hydrogels

* Hydrophilic structures
* Cross-linked structures
* e.g. Phema used in contact lenses
