# Transport Phenomena

* Three topics: 
    * fluid dynamics, 
    * heat transfer, and
    * mass transfer

* Important properties that are measured/described are the mass, momentum,
  energy, and angular momentum.

* Three levels at which it can be studied:
    * macroscopic level
        * equations for these are 'macroscopic balances'
        * no effort is made to understand the details of the system
        * the aim is to make a global assessment of the system
    * microscopic level
        * equations for these are 'equations of change'
        * how properties change within a small region
        * the aim is to get information about velocity, temperature, pressure,
          and concentration profiles within the system
    * molecular level
        * the aim is to understand the mechanisms of the properties in terms of
          molecular structure and intermolecular forces
