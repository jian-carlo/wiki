## Research

### Definition of Biomaterials Two possible descriptions of biomaterials

From [What is a Biomaterial?][1]

There are two descriptions of biomaterials:

* A material that is derived from biological organisms such as plants, animal
  fungi.
* Any material that is artificially engineered for biocompatibility for treating
  an injury, replacing body parts. Usually synthetic.

### Polymeric Biomaterials

From [What is a Biomaterial?][1]

* The most abundant biomaterials are produced by living organisms.
* DNA and RNA are two of the most important polymeric biomaterials responsible
  for protein synthesis. Proteins are also polymeric biomaterials.
* Cellulose is the MOST abundant organic polymer, a polysaccharide. Another
  polysaccharide is starch.
* The second most abundant polymer on earth is the polyphenol, found in many
  fruits, vegetables, chocolate and grains.

### Wood

* Wood is one of the most important biomaterials. Humans discovered fire by striking
  stone and wood. To let the fire burn for even longer, wood was the readily
  available fuel.
* Wood is used in carpentry and artmaking billions of structures, ships, furniture
  and sculptures were made of wood.

#### What is wood made of?

From [The Chemistry of Fire and Gunpowder][2]

* Wood is made of three types of molecules, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin
    * Cellulose is organized  
    * Hemicellulose is not much organized
    * Lignin has different types of aromatic groups in it, responsible for the
    hardness of the wood
* Most of the wood inside the bark is dead xylem
* Wood creates a "blood clot" instead of blood, it is 'sap' 
* Burning wood produces three things or at least three states of matter. A 
flammable gas, a thick orange liquid, and black charcoal.
    * The liquid is called a pyroligneous distillate
        * It is actually composed of two layers, the oily layer comes from the aromatic
        lignins. 
        * The aqueous layer is made up of methanol ("wood alcohol"), acetic acid
        ("wood vinegar"), and acetone.
    * The gas is composed of three main gases, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and methane.
    * The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin as they pyrolyze, they form a wide
    variety of shorter molecules
    * *Charcoal*, the solid left behind by wood pyrolysis is almost pure carbon, 90
    to 99% carbon

From [Wood Composition][3]

* *Cellulose* is the primary strengthenin material in wood
* *Lignin* is amorphous in form, acts as matrix or binder for the cellulose
* *Hemicellulose* partly crystalline polymer that also acts as a matrix
* *Water*
* *Extractives*

* At the microscopic level, wood is composed of long cells, in the axial direction
and thin cells in the radial and tangential direction
* The smallest microstructural component of wood is called a microfibril. 
Microfibrils are bundles of cellulose chains covered first by hemicellulose 
and then by lignin.

#### Mechanical Properties of Wood

To understand the mechanical properties of wood let us see it upclose first.

* Trees have evolved to withstand storms.
    * Trees have a trunk that is nearly cylindrical in shape this contributes to
      its stiffness. This is efficient for battling strong winds since every side 
      is equal in shape, there are no weak spots the the wind can attack.

    ![Tangential and Radial Shrinkage](https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000117796/www.mcilvain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/woodmovement.jpg)
    * The core of a trunk is the pith, which is made up of soft parenchyma; this
      is where the growth of a tree starts. In woodworking, it is important that
      a plank does not contain the pith since it composes of very weak and less
      dense tissue. And also, wood shrinks in the drying process as it loses
      moisture. The tangential shrinkage is stronger than the radial shrinkage
      by about 3.14 (ideally) (for real trees about 4 to 5 times greater.) This
      mismatch creates hoop stress, which causes *wood checking* (cracks). This
      is prevalent in wood planks containing the piths, see image above.
