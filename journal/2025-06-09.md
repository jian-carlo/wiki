__(10:04)__ I want to populate my notes

__(10:06)__ I want to clean up my nvim config
                - [ ] Clean up neovim config

__(10:30)__ I have fever and cough so I won't be attending the exam today.

__(11:20)__ I want a plugin that allows me to send code blocks in markdown
            and send them to a REPL or something
                - try out vim-slime
                - i think i dont need it
                - keep plugins as little as possible

__(11:26)__ Yep that should be the philosophy:
            Have a very minimal init.lua

__(12:09)__ I have resolved a conflict in git and its actually quite easy
            What I did:
                - `git push` and find out that the remote is ahead by x commits
                - do `git rebase` or something, I don't remember.
                - do `git status` and find the conflicted files,
                - open neovim and find files with:
                    - `HEAD` and `your commit`
                    - `HEAD` must mean the remote and the latter is my local commit
                    - edit the files and save then stage and commit again
                    - this time we specify a branch to push to `HEAD:<branch-name>`
                    - delete your local repo and clone again (not so elegant, im sure
                      there is a more appropriate solution)

__(12:17)__ - Wait gitsigns is very cool
            - maybe i should journal in lists

__(12:18)__ - I'm configuring tmux and neovim to respect 'light and dark themes'

__(13:24)__ - That is done hell yeah
            - Now i need to:
                - [x] When pressing enter the indentation and list label are auto
                - [ ] When opening journal or index (wiki), be in a tmux server

__(13:27)__ - quick thing: upon exit, the tmux bar changes back to dark if it is light

__(16:29)__
- I have made it so that when I open wiki or journal it will
  automatically attach to a tmux server
- I can't use touch to scroll though
- Change format of the journal, make it so that the timestamp
  is like a heading

__(16:39)__
- Maybe I can use the default launcher since Nova Launcher
  runs on top of the default Xiaomi OS launcher.

__(18:37)__
- Xiaomi Launcher is bad it does not let me change icon packs
  it does not disable the gesture for news (i dont know if it does)
